## General Information
As an employee having a good daily schedule is a blueprint for a sucessful work life. Knowing what you’re meant to be doing (and when) creates a sense of purpose, meaning, and focus. It helps you avoid procrastination, stay motivated, and properly manage your time. This work day scheduler will keep you on track each work day. You are able to see the time, date and time blocks for traditional work hours (9am - 5pm). The time block are colour-coded based on the current time. If the time is in the past, you will not be able to enter tasks in the time blocks and it will be gray. If the current time and the time block are the same, the colour of that time block will be red. The time block will be green if the time hasn't come yet, signifying future time for that day. At the end of the day(midnight), the tasks/ notes entered for that day are removed from local storage so you have a fresh new start for the next day.
